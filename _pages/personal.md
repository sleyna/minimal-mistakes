    <p>I love hiking (and camping). My favorite memories have been made on my countless hikes through the Alps with my dad.</p>
    <p>However, I experienced the most picturesque views on my 2-week hike and wild camping trip through Iceland. The scenery changed every day from colorful mountains to glaciers to rocky volcanic trails.</p>

    <p>In my free time I also like to run. On top of my bucket list are the Svalbard marathon and the Boston marathon, next up: Berlin Marathon 2025.</p>

    <p>Apart from running I enjoy bouldering and climbing. I finally went ice climbing in February 2023 and February 2024.</p>

    <p>I prefer walking and biking over any other form of commuting all year round. My most recent longer one-day biking trip was 100 miles following the Berlin Wall.</p>
    <p>The cycling path runs along the former customs route in West Berlin and along the Column Track in East Berlin. It took me through rich green forests, extensive fields and picturesque meadows, along rivers and idyllic lakes. Going through the city formed a contrast to the beautiful nature: historical and modern architecture and straight canals.</p>

    <p>As you might have guessed from various doodles on my pages, I like drawing, doodling, photography when traveling and having a crafty project here and there. One of which I’m very proud of is my chocolate dragon eggs. In 2019, a group of friends and I had a regular watch party for the new GoT episodes. For the series finale we brought themed food. I made 8" tall chocolate dragon eggs, and hid toy dragons inside. I used shredded almonds as scales and painted them with edible paint.</p>

    <p>After high school I spent some time in Myanmar at a Buddhist monastery teaching Mathematics and English at its school. We spent some time rebuilding houses, school facilities, and a hospital that had been destroyed by Cyclone Nargis. During my time there I also ran into Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. 🤓 I miss the people, the smell of the forest and the Burmese tea.</p>

  <p>I am a fan of puzzles: my favorite puzzle book is <em>536 Puzzles & Curious Problems</em> by Henry Ernst Dudeney. I recently found <em>The Language Lover's Puzzle Book</em> by Alex Bellos, which I can highly recommend.</p>
